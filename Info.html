        <div class="faqs">
           <details>
              <summary>Do I need to wear a face covering?</summary>
              <p class="text">Whilst in your vehicle, or within your car free bay, we do not require any face coverings to be worn.

                If you need to leave your vehicle or bay for any reason we ask that, unless exempt under the current guidelines, you wear a face covering whilst moving around the arena.</p>
           </details>
           <details>
              <summary>What time should I arrive and when does the show start?</summary>
              <p class="text">We open our doors 45 minutes before the performance begins. Make sure to have the barcode ready (either in printed form or on your mobile phone display) to speed things up! All our movies start at the advertised time.

                Admission cannot be guaranteed once the film has started and we cannot provide refunds for latecomers. </p>
           </details>
           <details>
              <summary>Is there wheelchair access?</summary>
              <p class="text">Yes the site is fully wheelchair accessible and we have disabled toilet access. If you’d like your bay to be near the toilets, let us know when you arrive</p>
           </details>
           <details>
            <summary>Are children allowed?</summary>
            <p class="text">Absolutely! The Drive In is fun for the whole family and we have a whole dedicated programme of family shows - just make sure junior meets the film's age certification. Our crew do have to check to make sure all audience members are the right age for the film - so you’ll need to hold some valid ID up to the window for inspection. The only exception is babes in arms - babies under 12 months of age are allowed to all shows regardless of age rating.</p>
         </details>
         <details>
            <summary>Can I bring a dog to the screening?</summary>
            <p class="text">Sure! Dogs are welcome so long as you are coming by car, but we ask that you don’t take your furry friend for walks or toilet breaks and don't bring any dogs with a tendency to bark out of respect for your fellow audience members!</p>
         </details>
         <details>
            <summary>What happens if it rains?</summary>
            <p class="text">We'll go ahead in most weather, including rainfall, and will never cancel a show before the advertised start time - it's amazing how often it can rain all day and then clear up just in time for the action to start! In the unlikely event that it isn't possible to go ahead or complete a show, your tickets can be exchanged for another date.</p>
